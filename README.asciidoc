# cargo-maven-plugin-email-server-issue
Small project reproducer exhibiting the problem

The problem is at WAR deploy, something is connecting to the email server, encounters a problem, and then causes a shutdown.  The error says "Port number N ... is in use", but nothing is running on that port.

The error occurs no matter what the port number is.

However, when removing the two email properties used with Spring Boot, the problem goes away:
  spring.mail.host=localhost
  spring.mail.port=15025
(of course, that makes the app use the production-configured values so not a solution!)

To reproduce, run "mvn install" in empty-war dir and then in acceptance-test dir.
